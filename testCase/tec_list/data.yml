            Flatiron promotes code organization and sustainability by clearly 
            separating development concerns. Each component works elegantly with or without 
            its counterparts. Many of the components work the same in the browser as they 
            do on the server.This is the motivation behind flatiron. At it's core flatiron is two things:<br/>
            1) an initiative to build a collection of decoupled tools with the same standard of quality and performance that you would expect from anything built by nodejitsu.<br/> 
            2) a full-stack web application development framework which packages these tools together to make isomorphic and stream-based application development easier.<br/>
